          But we know if it's not easy, you won’t do it. And if it doesn’t taste
          good, you won’t want it. We believe in simple, effortless solutions
          designed for the unpredictability of real life, that’s why our meals
          aren’t just ready in minutes, or just delicious, or just nutritious.

          <p>We look at both the amount of sugar used and the source.</p>

            While the average American is consuming 100 grams of sugar a day,
            our meals average 8 grams per meal, which means 60%+ reduction every
            week.

            The American diet is estimated to contain more than 60%

          <p>What we leave out</p>
          <p>
            Meals are only as good as the quality of the ingredients that go
            into them, so you’ll never find artificial flavors, chemical
            preservatives, or excess sugar in our food. Many of our meals are
            certified gluten-free and each and every meal excludes 85+ banned
            ingredients Freshly® says “no” to.
